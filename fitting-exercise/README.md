This is the Week 8 Model Fitting Exercise

The data folder contains the raw data from this week's assignment.

The fitting-exercise.qmd file focuses on data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (boxplot creation, Pearson's Correlation testing, and summary tables), and model fitting for logistic regression and linear regression. More of the code's function is explained in further detail inside of the file itself.
