Or you could have a subfolder for exploratory analysis, another for final analysis. The options are endless, choose whatever makes sense for your project. For this template, there is just a a single folder, but having sub-folders is often a good idea."

For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/86182/Desktop/EPID 8060E/MADA/vincentnguyen-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

This dataset contains gun murder data for 2010 reported by FBI, and is sourced from Wikipedia. The dataset is organized by states, with the population of each state included.\n\n# Load required package\nlibrary(dslabs) # This package has the murders dataset\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(maps) # This package is used to make a map\n\n\nAttaching package: 'maps'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    map\n\n# Look at help file for murders data\nhelp(murders)\n\nFirst of all, let’s take a look at the data structure.\n\n# Determine the type of murders\nclass(murders)\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\n# Get an overview of data structure\nstr(murders)\n\n'data.frame':   51 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ state     : chr  \"Alabama\" \"Alaska\" \"Arizona\" \"Arkansas\" ...\n $ abb       : chr  \"AL\" \"AK\" \"AZ\" \"AR\" ...\n $ region    : Factor w/ 4 levels \"Northeast\",\"South\",..: 2 4 4 2 4 4 1 2 2 2 ...\n $ population: num  4779736 710231 6392017 2915918 37253956 ...\n $ total     : num  135 19 232 93 1257 ...\n\n# Get a summary of data\nsummary(murders)\n\n    state               abb                      region     population      \n Length:51          Length:51          Northeast    : 9   Min.   :  563626  \n Class :character   Class :character   South        :17   1st Qu.: 1696962  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   North Central:12   Median : 4339367  \n                                       West         :13   Mean   : 6075769  \n                                                          3rd Qu.: 6636084  \n                                                          Max.   :37253956  \n     total       \n Min.   :   2.0  \n 1st Qu.:  24.5  \n Median :  97.0  \n Mean   : 184.4  \n 3rd Qu.: 268.0  \n Max.   :1257.0  \n\n# Check if there are missing values\nanyNA(murders)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nAs shown, there are 51 observations and 5 variables in this dataset. 51 states and their abbreviations are listed. The states are also classified by their geographic locations. Two numeric variables denote the population and number of gun murders of each state in 2010. Luckily, we don’t have any NA in this dataset.\n\n\nMap plotting\nSince we have data from different states, I want to make a map to compare the different gun murder rates by states. Here I calculate the gun murder rates as the number of gun murders divided by the population of each state. Then I use a heatmap to color the statesby their gun murder rates. Of note, the US map data is in the package maps, with the longitude and latitude of each state included. This tool makes it convenient for us to draw the heatmap.\nLet’s take a look at the data from package maps first.\n\n# Extract the US map data\nus_map &lt;- map_data(\"state\")\n\n# Determine the type of murders\nclass(us_map)\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\n# Get an overview of data structure\nstr(us_map)\n\n'data.frame':   15537 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ long     : num  -87.5 -87.5 -87.5 -87.5 -87.6 ...\n $ lat      : num  30.4 30.4 30.4 30.3 30.3 ...\n $ group    : num  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ order    : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ region   : chr  \"alabama\" \"alabama\" \"alabama\" \"alabama\" ...\n $ subregion: chr  NA NA NA NA ...\n\n# Get a summary of data\nsummary(us_map)\n\n      long              lat            group           order      \n Min.   :-124.68   Min.   :25.13   Min.   : 1.00   Min.   :    1  \n 1st Qu.: -96.22   1st Qu.:33.91   1st Qu.:15.00   1st Qu.: 3899  \n Median : -87.61   Median :38.18   Median :26.00   Median : 7794  \n Mean   : -89.67   Mean   :38.18   Mean   :30.15   Mean   : 7798  \n 3rd Qu.: -79.13   3rd Qu.:42.80   3rd Qu.:47.00   3rd Qu.:11699  \n Max.   : -67.01   Max.   :49.38   Max.   :63.00   Max.   :15599  \n    region           subregion        \n Length:15537       Length:15537      \n Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                      \n                                      \n                                      \n\n\nAs shown, all state names are in stored in the region variable in lower case. Variables long and lat have the longitude and latitude of each state’s border. As this is a well prepared data, I will calculate gun murder rates in the murders dataset and then merge it into us_map.\n\n# Prepare the murders data\nmurders &lt;- murders %&gt;%\n  mutate(state_low=tolower(state), # Convert state names to lower case\n         rate=total/population) # Calculate gun murder rate\n\nmap_data &lt;- us_map %&gt;%\n  left_join(murders, by=c(\"region\"=\"state_low\"))\n\nAs the data for plotting is well prepared, I will use geom_polygon() function to draw the map and then color each state by gun murder rates. The geom_polygon() function is a useful tool for connecting a group of points by a certain order. In our case, it’s used to draw the border line of each state.\n\n# Draw a heatmap of gun murder rates\nus_gmr &lt;- ggplot(map_data, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group, fill=rate))+\n  geom_polygon(color=\"steelblue4\", linewidth=1)+ # Draw border line of states\n  scale_fill_gradient(name=\"Gun murder rate\", \n                      low=\"white\", high=\"firebrick4\")+ # Define color gradient\n  theme_bw()+\n  labs(title=\"Gun murder rate by state\", x=\"Longitude\", y=\"Latitude\")+\n  theme(axis.title.x=element_text(size=10, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.y=element_text(size=10, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.text.x=element_text(color=\"black\", size=8),\n        axis.text.y=element_text(color=\"black\", size=8),\n        plot.title=element_text(size=15, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        legend.position=\"right\",\n        legend.title=element_text(size=10, face=\"bold\"))\n\nus_gmr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the map shows, the gun murder rate is higher overall in the southern US. For the northern US, the northwest has a lower gun murder rate than the northeast. This map demonstrate the geographic distribution of gun murder rates.\n\n\nModel fitting\nAs the response of interest is gun murder rate, it’s intuitive to fit a Poisson regression with a log link function. In the Poisson regression model, the number of gun murders is the response, and the population of each state is the offset. The region of states is a predictor to show if gun murder rate is different across different regions.\nBefore that, let’s make a grouped boxplot to see if the difference is evident. Here I use region as the X-axis and gun murder rate as the Y-axis.\n\nboxplot &lt;- ggplot(murders, aes(x=region, y=rate))+\n  geom_boxplot(color=\"firebrick3\", width=.5, linewidth=1)+\n  theme_bw()+\n  labs(title=\"Gun murder rate by region\", x=\"Region\", y=\"Gun murder rate\")+\n  theme(axis.title.x=element_text(size=10, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.title.y=element_text(size=10, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        axis.text.x=element_text(color=\"black\", size=8),\n        axis.text.y=element_text(color=\"black\", size=8),\n        plot.title=element_text(size=15, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n        legend.position=\"right\",\n        legend.title=element_text(size=10, face=\"bold\"))\nboxplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown, the gun murder rate in southern US is evidently higher compared to other regions. The northeast, north central region, and west of the US have similar gun murder rate, though the median in the west is a little lower.\nNow, let’s fit a Poisson regression model to see if the regional difference is statistically significant. As indicated by the map above, the southern US has a generally lower gun murder rate. So I want to use South as the reference group and adjust the factor levels of region.\n\n# Adjust factor level of region\nmurders$region_fct &lt;- factor(murders$region, levels=c(\"South\", \"North Central\", \"West\", \"Northeast\"))\n\n# Poisson regression: gun murder rate ~ region\npoi_fit &lt;- glm(total ~ region_fct, offset=log(population), family=\"poisson\", data=murders)\nsummary(poi_fit)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = total ~ region_fct, family = \"poisson\", data = murders, \n    offset = log(population))\n\nDeviance Residuals: \n   Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max  \n-8.784  -4.529  -2.416   0.889  12.619  \n\nCoefficients:\n                         Estimate Std.

The north central US has a 25% decrease in gun murder rate compared to southern US. The western and northeastern US both have about 27% decrease in gun murder rate than southern US. Notably, the coefficient for north central US, western US, and northeastern US are all negative with p-values lower than 0.05. We have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the gun murder rates in these three regions are significantly lower compared to southern US."

    "text": "Hello, I am Vincent Nguyen\n\n\nI am 4th year undergraduate student in the Double Dawgs program. I intend to pursue an MPH, specifically in Epidemiology. In the past, I have been involved in research labs that utilize R but definitely not to the extent MADA does. I have dabbled in statistical analysis, machine learning modeling, and more. This course I am to solidify my skills in R (I have used free courses, however, have felt the need for more formal training). I also want to explore more advanced and modern techniques in statistical analysis like machine learning.\n\nFun fact about me is that I love to play games and watch movies. Currently, I am a top ranked player in Fortnite (Top 1000!) and in Marvel Rivals (Top 3%). My favorite movies are Tenet and Star Wars The Force Awakens.\n\n\nCareer\nCurrently, I am involved in the Sundaram Lab at UGA and an intern for the CDC’s Division of Workforce Development. I aim to become an Epidemiologist or Biostatistician with the skills learned from this class! Some of my research interests include oncology, infectious disease ecology, and parasitology.\n\n\n\n\nHighlighted Data Analysis Technique\nThe application of simulated environments for analyzing changes in health policy is something I am greatly interested in. For example, this article details the use of EU-TOPIA, an evaluation tool designed to allow researchers use country-specific data to quantify the potential benefits and harms of diferent cancer guidelines in their respective country. Going forward, I believe the application of simulated environments can help bolster research at a low cost!"
