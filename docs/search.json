Or you could have a subfolder for exploratory analysis, another for final analysis. The options are endless, choose whatever makes sense for your project. For this template, there is just a a single folder, but having sub-folders is often a good idea."

For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/vince/OneDrive/Desktop/port-MADA/vincentnguyen-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nWarning: package 'skimr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

This indicates significance. Model 2, “Fit2”, is a model with population size as a predictor and life expectancy as the outcome. This model has a p-value of 0.6159. This indicates insignificance.\n\n# Fit Model 1 - Life Expectancy and Infant Mortality\nfit1 &lt;- lm(life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = africadata_twothousand)\n\n# summary of fit model 1\nsummary(fit1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = life_expectancy ~ infant_mortality, data = africadata_twothousand)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-22.6651  -3.7087   0.9914   4.0408   8.6817 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

    "text": "Hello, I am Vincent Nguyen\n\n\nI am 4th year undergraduate student in the Double Dawgs program. I intend to pursue an MPH, specifically in Epidemiology. In the past, I have been involved in research labs that utilize R but definitely not to the extent MADA does. I have dabbled in statistical analysis, machine learning modeling, and more. This course I am to solidify my skills in R (I have used free courses, however, have felt the need for more formal training). I also want to explore more advanced and modern techniques in statistical analysis like machine learning.\n\nFun fact about me is that I love to play games and watch movies. Currently, I am a top ranked player in Fortnite (Top 1000!) and in Marvel Rivals (Top 3%). My favorite movies are Tenet and Star Wars The Force Awakens.\n\n\nCareer\nCurrently, I am involved in the Sundaram Lab at UGA and an intern for the CDC’s Division of Workforce Development. I aim to become an Epidemiologist or Biostatistician with the skills learned from this class! Some of my research interests include oncology, infectious disease ecology, and parasitology.\n\n\n\n\nHighlighted Data Analysis Technique\nThe application of simulated environments for analyzing changes in health policy is something I am greatly interested in. For example, this article details the use of EU-TOPIA, an evaluation tool designed to allow researchers use country-specific data to quantify the potential benefits and harms of diferent cancer guidelines in their respective country. Going forward, I believe the application of simulated environments can help bolster research at a low cost!"

Whichever approach you choose, add ample documentation/commentary so you and others can easily understand what’s going on and what is done."
